I am a Doctor of Medicine, specializing in Medical Biology. I have two master's degrees in Emergence of Parasitic and Infectious Diseases (University of Montpellier, France) and Ecology of Infectious Diseases (Ecom-Alger, University of Kinshasa, DRC). Since 2017, I have worked with the Virology department led by Prof. Steve Ahuka at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB), and have experience in serology and the molecular diagnosis of emerging and re-emerging diseases such as Ebola, yellow fever, and measles. Since 2018, I have also worked in the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Laboratory and Pathogen Sequencing Lab.
