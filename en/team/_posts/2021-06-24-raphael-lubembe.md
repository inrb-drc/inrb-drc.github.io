As a medical doctor who graduated from the University of Kinshasa and a current postgraduate student in Microbiology at the Kinshasa University Hospital, I work as Medical Chief of Staff at Assossa Medical Center. I am a member of the planning and research division of The National Program for Dracunculiasis Eradication. Before joining the Pathogen Sequencing Lab and Biorepository, I co-investigated the prevalence of HIV among women sex workers in Kinshasa. Additionally, I participated in research on vaginal candidiasis due to Candida Africanus in the Gynecology Service at the Kinshasa University Hospital.
