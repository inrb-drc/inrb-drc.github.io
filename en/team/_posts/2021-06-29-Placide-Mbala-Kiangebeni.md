I am Doctor of Medicine, Specialist in Medical Biology Option Microbiology and PhD with at least 10 years of experience in the molecular diagnosis of emerging diseases such as hemorrhagic viral fevers and monkeypox. From 2013 to 2015, I coordinated the laboratory of the PREDICT project based at the Institut National de Recherche Biom√©dicale in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where I was also involved in the study on the prevalence of HIV / AIDS among the soldiers of the Armed Forces of the DRC. During the last Ebola outbreak in 2014 in the DRC, I supervised the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Laboratory and confirmed the cause of the epidemic through molecular biology (PCR and sequencing). I also participated in the training of laboratory technicians of the Ministry of Public Health in the preparation and response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Between August 2015 and July 2016, I received a grant from the Directorate General for Development Cooperation (Belgium) to take a master's course in public health sciences option disease control at the Institute of Tropical Medicine (IMT) of Antwerp, Belgium. From July 2016 to July 2017, I have joined Metabiota DRC as a Project Coordinator of the PREDICT project under the USAID-EPT program in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Currently, I am the head of Epidemiology Department, head of the pathogen genomic laboratory and also in charge of Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Unit at INRB for diagnostic and response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in DR Congo.
