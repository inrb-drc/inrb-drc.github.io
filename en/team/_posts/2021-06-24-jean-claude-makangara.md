Since 2020, I have been working on collecting and analyzing specimens of suspected patients with COVID-19 during the COVID-19 outbreak response at Institut National de Recherche Biom√©dicale (INRB) and Kinshasa University Hospital. I graduated from the University of Kinshasa with a medical degree in 2021. I am a postgraduate student in Microbiology at the Kinshasa University Hospital and a physician on call at "SOS Medecins de Nuit." I previously worked as a lab team member of the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) at the COVID-19 treatment center at Kinshasa University Hospital.
