I have a Bachelor's degree in Medical Biology from the Institute Superior of Medical Techniques in Kinshasa. Currently, I am in charge of sequencing in the Pathogen Sequencing Lab. I was previously responsible for the field sequencing laboratory in Katwa, North Kivu Province in DRC, during the 2018-2020 North Kivu Ebola virus disease outbreak. I also worked at the Mobile Ebola Laboratory at the Beni and Butembo sites in North Kivu in DRC. From 2012 to 2018, I was the Head of Laboratory Section at the National Program of Hygiene at the Borders in Kinshasa.
