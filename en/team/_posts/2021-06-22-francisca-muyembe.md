Trained in medical microbiology in Japan, I worked as a lab scientist in a molecular biology lab focused on virus identification in animals. I was also involved in following and evaluating People Living with HIV in the army. I participated in yellow fever virus research among people vaccinated with the minimal dose and serology research among survivors of the 1995 Ebola virus disease outbreak and healthcare service personnel in Kikwit.
