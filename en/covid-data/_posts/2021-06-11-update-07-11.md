In total, we received 119 samples including 23 from Doko (Haut Uélé), 51 from Haut Katanga, 10 from Kongo Central and 35 from Kinshasa. Only 100 samples were analyzed as 19 had very low concentrations. Of the 100 samples, only 54 samples had sequences with a viral genome coverage greater than 75% therefore supported for the analysis of variants. **The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) represents approximately 74% (40/54) and is present in the samples taken in all 3 provinces and in the samples from Kinshasa.**
