<p>In the version of this Article originally published, the sentence beginning “We also used MPSSE to enrich…” should have stated that the samples were from a patient who developed a fatal viral encephalitis following a ‘mosquito bite’ rather than a ‘tick bite’. The sentence has now been corrected to read: “We also used MSSPE to enrich for Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) in post-mortem brain tissue samples from a patient who developed a fatal viral encephalitis following a mosquito bite”.</p>
