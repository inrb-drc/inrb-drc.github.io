<p>Summary
During the 2018-2020 Nord Kivu Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an individual who had received the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was diagnosed with EVD. His treatment included an Ebola virus-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb114), and he recovered within 14 days but re-presented six months later with severe EVD-like illness and Ebola virus viremia and died. We initiated an epidemiological and genomic investigation that showed the patient had a relapse of acute EVD, which led to a transmission chain that resulted in 91 cases spanning six health zones over four-months.</p>
