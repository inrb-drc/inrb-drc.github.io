## About us
Since June 2018, the laboratory capacity for performance of whole-genome sequencing have been established in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the “Institut National de la Recherche Biomédicale (INRB)” in Kinshasa.

The pathogen genomic laboratory collects and sequences infectious diseases samples for surveillance, to aid the epidemiological response to pathogens such as Ebola, Virus and SARS-CoV-2. In fact, we have been involved in the last ebola outbreaks (9th,10th,11th,12th) that occurred in DRC and in detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in DRC and Central Africa. We are also involved in the detection of monkeypox and other hemorrhagic fever etc. 

Our work provide important context for frontline workers to acquire specific actionable information in real time. Our approach provides much-needed support for understanding and responding to infectious disease burden in the DRC and other countries.
